# Bank System
It is a Basic Bank System CLI app.
We can add Clients and Accounts,
View Client and Account Info,
See whole bank (Its accounts sand clients),
Withdraw/deposit money from any account.

How to make it functional??
1) Make 3 txt files:   Persons.txt,  Accounts.txt,  Clients.txt

3) Save All the files including these three text files in a package named as BankSys (Package Name may differ, and you can change it in your files )

5) If you are using IntelliJ then the package should be in src folder of the project.

7) In persons.txt we will enter data manually in the sequence: name,cnic,number.

9) Comment the loadAll() function written on top of the driver and add client, then add accounts. After adding each one of them, Uncomment the loadAll() function and now, your Menu Driven code is ready to use.
